    <h2>Recipe description</h2>
    <p>Ají de gallina is a Peruvian chicken stew. The dish is considered a popular Peruvian comfort food, and the name
    translates to "chicken chili" or "hen's chili" in English.</p>
    <p>Ají de gallina is composed of a sofrito base made by sautéing red onion, garlic, and ají amarillo together, and adding
    shredded poached poultry and stock.</p>
    <p>The stew is then thickened with bread soaked in milk or evaporated milk, cheese such as parmesan, and ground nuts such
    as pecans or walnuts.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A chicken breast</li>
        <li>a bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 cups of mixed vegetables (carrot, celery and leek)</li>
        <li>a french bread</li>
        <li>2 cups of milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup of oil</li>
        <li>a chopped onion</li>
        <li>4 minced garlic cloves</li>
        <li>½ cup of yellow pepper cream</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon toothpick</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cumin</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the breast with salt, laurel and vegetables, separate the broth and fray the hen. Then, crumble the bread and let
        it soak for a few minutes in a cup of milk, to finally blend it. Reserve the preparation.</li>
        <li>Separately, in a pot, prepare the dressing with five tablespoons of oil, onion, garlic cloves, yellow chili cream, cumin

        constantly, adding the broth.</li>
        <li>Season, add the remaining milk and cook over low heat. Incorporate the frayed chicken, the pecans, and spread the
