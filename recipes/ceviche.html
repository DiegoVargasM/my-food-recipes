    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1kg. White fish fillet</li>
        <li>¼ Cup coriander</li>
        <li>2 Limo peppers or serrano peppers</li>
        <li>6 Lemons or limes</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin with, <strong>we chop the fish fillets into small squares or cubes of approximately 1 centimeter</strong>; then chop the onions
        into fine julienne strips and the chili peppers into small pieces.</li>
        <li>In a deep container, preferably glass or metal, add the fish, the peppers and the onions, then squeeze the lemon juice
        over them, season with salt and pepper to taste and leave to marinate for about 10 minutes in the fridge so that the
        fish cooks with lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, chop the pepper into small pieces and chop the coriander leaves into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Remove the fish from the fridge and add the cilantro and the pepper; drain a little of the lemon juice and add the
        tablespoons of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients and taste the taste, if necessary add a little more salt and pepper and then mix again.</li>
        <li>You can serve immediately, <em>but if you want,</em> you can leave another 5 minutes marinating in the fridge to intensify the
        flavor a little more.</li>
    </ol>
