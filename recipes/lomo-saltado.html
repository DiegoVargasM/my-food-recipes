    <h2 class="subtitle">Recipe description</h2>
    <p class="content">Lomo saltado is an extremely popular dish of so-called fusion cuisine that combines the Chinese gastronomy tradition of
    sauteing food with Peruvian ingredients such as yellow pepper, cilantro, and tomato.</p>
    <p class="content">This succulent main dish is always accompanied with white rice and French fries</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="content">
        <li>a pound of beef tenderloin cut into thin strips/li>
        <li>two inely chopped garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>a small thickly sliced purple onion</li>
        <li>two thinly sliced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 yellow pepper sliced into two thin strips</li>
        <li>two tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>two potato chip cups</li>
        <li>White rice as a side</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="content">
        <li>Season the meat with garlic, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place a wok or skillet over very high heat. Add the oil and sauté the meat, a few strips at a time (2 minutes per batch)
        so they don't sweat, but instead brown.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, tomato, chili and sauté everything for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The tomatoes and onion should be
        crisp, not mushy. Add the soy sauce and vinegar to the sides of the wok or pan and mix everything together. Add the beef
        broth and cook an additional 1 1/2 minutes. Taste it to adjust the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, add the chopped cilantro and serve immediately with French fries and white rice.</li>
    </ol>
